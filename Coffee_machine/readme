those are a little test to learn how to use tkinter with python3

a manual is available here : http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/

the idea was to code a "coffee machine" that talks, (Im a little

obsessed with coffee and I feel really alone)

compile with pyhton3 the file init (1 or 2 or ...) to see the different steps

of what I learned.

enjoy
